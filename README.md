# Image_Classification_on_ImageNet
Image classification project using Tiny ImageNet with ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, and MobileNetV2. Models are trained for 15 epochs and compared based on accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curves to evaluate performance on a reduced version of the ImageNet dataset.
